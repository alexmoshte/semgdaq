 *
 *  This header file holds all the variables and buffers within a struct that are neccessary to implement the sorting algorithm and all fucnction declarations
 *  for the same algorithm. The sorting algorithm is responsible for scanning the DMA buffer that stores data for all channels (IN1 and IN2 for ADC1 and ADC3.
 *  IN3 and IN4 for ADC2) loading each value from the buffer and storing it in buffers that now hold data for respective channels
