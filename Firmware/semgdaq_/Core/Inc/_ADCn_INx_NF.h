 * This header file consists of all the variables and pointers that are to be fed to the CMSIS DSP functions for IIR biquad filter implementation
 * for a notch filter that attenuates 50hZ powerline interference noise. The variables and pointers are declared in the form of a structure
 * upon which every member of the struct is accessed by a pointer. That way, the input arguments of the DSP functions are fed as members of a
 * struct.
