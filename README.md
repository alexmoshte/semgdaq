semgdaq is a wearable 6 channel data acquisition unit for capturing surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals from human arm muscles using SJ2-3593D jack connectors while conditioning, digitizing, processing and transmitting them as sEMG data to an external AI accelerated board through an SM12B-SRSS IDC connector where AI models are run for various applications including robotic control, muscle signals medical assessment and gesture recognition. The board leverages INA125P instrumentation amplifiers together with filter stages utilizing LM324QT op-amps for conditioning and an STM32G4A1VET6 microcontroller for the digitization, processing and data transmission of the signals. Since AI models can only be as good as the data, the design of such a DAQ is necessary to ensure clean, reliable and real-time data for AI applications requiring sEMG data. The board also has USB-FS and JTAG to cater for debugging. The board also has external flash memory to extend its processing capability. The power (5V) is fed through a screw terminal and is regulated by two LDK320AM LDO regulators to offer 5V, 3.3V and 1.8V to meet the requirements of various components on the board. Link to the PCB design project can be found on the repo's profile. Here, I upload the manufacturing files for the board and the STM32CUBEIDE firmware and applications code for the operation of the board
